The second pivot happened in co-design Round 2, when Meher and Stephanie revealed that specialist teachers experience every pain point at higher intensity than general classroom teachers — fragmented schedules across multiple classrooms, per-student documentation, and the lowest priority in school-wide scheduling. Competitive analysis confirmed no product addressed their workflow: Magic School, Brisk, and ClassDojo all target general classrooms.",

Concept validation showed that specialists don't work in isolated tasks — they move through continuous rhythms of sessions, transitions, disruptions, and documentation.
